**VISEM-Tracking: Human Spermatozoa Tracking Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 29370 images with 656335 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *sperm*, *small or pinhead*, and *cluster*.

Images in the VISEM-Tracking dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 174 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (29370 images). Additionally, every image contains information about patients ***abstinence time***, ***age***, and ***body mass index***.
